**OSCP Notes - Tyler Ramsbey**

### Questions and Answers

1. **Regarding report writing for the OSCP, do you need to explain the rationale or just list them out in detail?**
   - You do not need to explain the rationale, but it's important not to just include screenshots. The graders will likely copy-paste your report to recreate your process, so detailed steps are essential.

2. **I understand the OSCP is 80% enumeration and 20% exploitation. What are your thoughts?**
   - Encounter ports, check them, and document initial entry for each port. For example, if you find port 21/FTP, refer to your old CTF notes and use those for guidance.

3. **I understand you took TCM before doing OSCP. Which TCM specifically, and what was the experience like?**
   - I took the Practical Ethical Hacking (PEH) course, which covers PEN-200 topics. I enjoyed it and found it very beneficial.

4. **What would you consider to be the biggest obstacle for the OSCP?**
   - The biggest obstacle is the mental challenge. Exploiting machines is manageable, but the 24-hour report period can lead to exhaustion and frustration. I recommend doing a dry run: give yourself 24 hours to complete a mock exam and see if you would pass.

5. **I’m not an active CTF player and tend to give up when I’m stuck. While I know that doing labs on THM/HTB/Proving Grounds is good for experience, what tips do you have for someone like me?**
   - Building muscle memory is crucial, similar to drilling moves in boxing. Aim to work on at least one box every day to prepare for the OSCP. Using walkthroughs is fine as long as you fully understand each step. If something feels overly complex, it likely is, so break it down and focus on understanding the basics first.
